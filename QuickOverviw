# Introduction to Game Development

## Overview of Game Design Concepts

### Game Genres
- **Platformers**: Games where the player navigates environments by jumping and avoiding obstacles (e.g., *Super Mario*).
- **Puzzles**: Games focused on logic and problem-solving (e.g., *Tetris*).
- **Top-Down Shooters**: Games with a bird's-eye view where the player typically shoots enemies (e.g., *Space Invaders*).
- **RPGs (Role-Playing Games)**: Games with character progression, storytelling, and strategic combat (e.g., *Final Fantasy*).

### Game Loop Structure
1. **Input**: Capturing player inputs (keyboard, mouse, gamepad).
2. **Update**: Processing game logic (player movement, collisions, AI).
3. **Render**: Drawing everything on the screen (sprites, UI elements, background).

### Key Concepts
- **Sprites**: 2D images or animations that represent objects in the game (e.g., characters, enemies, items).
- **Physics**: Handling movement, gravity, and collisions between objects (especially important in platformers and shooters).
- **UI (User Interface)**: On-screen elements like health bars, score counters, and menus.
- **Sound**: Music and sound effects that enhance the gameplay experience.

### Difference Between 2D and 3D Games
- **2D Games**: Movement and gameplay happen on a two-dimensional plane (x and y axes). Example: *Celeste*.
- **3D Games**: Adds a third dimension (z-axis) for depth, creating a more immersive environment. Example: *Minecraft*.
